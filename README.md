# Deep BSDE Solver, Primal and Dual bounds in Python using TensorFlow

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies. Using tensorflow-gpu is recommended.
2. Configure experiment. Examples can be found in main.py
3. (Optional) Point TensorBoard at the logging dir: `tensorboard --logdir=./train`
4. Run experiment, observe progress in TensorBoard at http://localhost:6006

## Dependencies

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [TensorBoard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
